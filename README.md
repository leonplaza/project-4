The dataset contains information about a sample of Airbnbs in New York from 2008 to 2022 with a total of 37108 Airbnb listings after cleaning. For each Airbnb announce, the data provides info about the year of creation, location, room type (private room, whole flat, etc), review rate, prices, among others. In addition, I used the NLTK’s SentimentIntensityAnalyzer library to check the polarization score on the listing’s name and house’s rules paragraphs.


## 1.- Is there a difference in price or rating in booking options or features such as cancellation policy,  verified host or instant booking?

We are going to check if there is a difference in price and rating when grouping by type of cancellation policy, if host is verified and if instant booking option is avaliable

Now lets check the results but grouped by each combination of the three variables

## 3.- Which area has the most expensive Airbnbs?

We are going see the price and rating of the neighborhoods and check if there is a relevant difference in terms of these values. The next plots summaries the distribution and average of the prices grouped by the neighborhood group
